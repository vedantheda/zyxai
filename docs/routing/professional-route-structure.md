# 🎯 **PROFESSIONAL ROUTE STRUCTURE FOR ZYXAI**

## 📋 **CURRENT ISSUES IDENTIFIED**

### **Unprofessional Routes to Remove:**
- `/debug-auth` - Debug route
- `/debug-env` - Debug route  
- `/setup` - Setup route
- `/setup-white-label` - Setup route
- `/ui-showcase` - Development showcase
- `/test-*` API routes - Test endpoints
- `/demo-*` API routes - Demo endpoints

### **Inconsistent Authentication:**
- Both `/login` and `/signin` exist
- Both `/register` and `/signup` exist
- Need to standardize to one set

### **Tax-Focused Content:**
- Routes and content focused on tax services
- Should be AI voice platform focused
